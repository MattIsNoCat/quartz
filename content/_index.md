Hey!

Welcome to Arcadian, my [[notes/Digital garden]]. 
You'll find all sorts of things here: ideas, essays, short stories, notes on various topics, etc. These are all connected by means of links, like [[notes/this one!]] You can jump around whatever you find interesting using those links, and find your way back using the links at the bottom (or your back button). 

But [[notes/who am I?]]

The main reason this place exists is as a means to collect my thoughts and practice [[Learning in public]]. For that reason, there will also be a lot of thoughts and pages that aren't finished, or are otherwise added to over time. Things will grow and change, and you'll get to see it happen if you follow along. 
Now, I understand if that isn't your cup of tea. I also have a collection of completed, curated posts down below.
