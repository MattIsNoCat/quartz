## What is a digital garden?
A digital garden is an online space that is made for learning and growing. The term allegories gardening: seeds sprout and are tended to so that they might grow into flowers or trees. That is also what you do in a digital garden: you spread the seeds of interesting thoughts, and tend to them over time, learning as you do so. 

As a means to consume, the digital garden is antithetical to the modern stream-based internet: whereas most sites nowadays are focused on a chronological feed of information, a garden is more concerned with the 'what' than the 'when'. You are free to explore a topic and its related subjects as much as you want without being bound to when it was posted. 

As a means to create, the digital garden foregoes a certain performativity: it is not meant to be a perfect showing of knowledge or skill. Instead, it is focused on sharing to journey of learning and its steps. Quite often we are expected, explicitly or implicitly, to share only the best: the best picture, the best memory, the best thought. That way, the chances are higher that we impress others with our work. With a garden, you embrace being wrong. Until you are right, hopefully.
