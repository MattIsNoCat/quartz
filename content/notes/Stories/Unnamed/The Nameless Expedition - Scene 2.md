The sun lazily creeps into the shop as Tess raises the metallic shutter blocking off the shop from the street. Immediately in front of her walks an old woman with a small wheeled bag trailing behind her. Tess rolls her eyes and sighs at her.

You’re late, girl. - Crone

Yeah, yeah. Morning to you too, Kelly. - Tess

Hmph - Crone, now Kelly.

The crone walks in and starts grabbing articles from the store’s all-too-varied supply. As soon as the screen is all the way up, Kelly walks back to the counter. She leans forward on the counter, her hands cupping her head, glaring at Kelly.
Then, a familiar voice disturbs her from her ill-wishing.

Orange the new seasonal colour? Looks good on you. - Jonny

Jonny grins, sitting on his bike just outside the store, as Tess pouts, her brightly orange coloured, ribbony uniform complementing the orange accents of the store walls. 

Honestly, this store has about as much consistent personality as you at a college party. - Tess

Jonny tries to pout but laughs as he sees Tess’ shit-eating grin. Tess’ classic expressions harshly contrasted the store’s cutesy uniform.

Why do you even work early mornings? You look like crap. - Jonny

Yeah, all right. Enough of that. - Tess

Ok. - Jonny

Jonny replies meekly to Tess’ stern voice, his eyes darting to his shoes.

Where you off to so early in the morning, anyway? - Tess

I’m meeting a girl for coffee. - Jonny

Really? - Tess

Yeah! Met her in my trigonometry class, and she’s from here, too. Apparently. - Jonny

Weird. - Tess

Nah. Maybe. Kinda. Went to school somewhere else, apparently. - Jonny

Lots of ‘apparently’s’ happening here. - Tess

She’s really cool, though. She--- - Jonny

Excuse me, girl. That’s not very polite, talking to someone and ignoring a customer. - Kelly

You just walked up to the counter. Save the drama for bridge night, Kelly. - Tess

I’m gonna be late, I’ll tell you about her tonight at Ventley’s. - Jonny

Wait, I’m not gonna--- - Tess

Just be there! - Jonny

Jonny rides off before Tess can mutter her further protests.

Ahem. - Kelly

Tess sighs.
