She’s not going to show. - Markus
No, she’ll be here. I told her to come. - Jonny
Jonny takes a sip from his drink as Markus sets the other two glasses down on the table and takes a seat.
We’re lucky you words are basically commandments to women. - Derick
Shut up. Besides, it’s Tess. My success with women doesn’t apply to her. - Jonny
Are you calling her easy? - Derick
Dude, chill with the witch hunt. It’s not a girl, it’s Tess. And I’ll have you know, after what I’ll tell you tonight, you’ll think differently about my experience with women. I’m no longer that awkward boy from high school. - Jonny
You’re absolutely right, Jonny. You’re at least two inches taller now. - Markus
Jonny sigh as hard as he could, and the other two laugh it off.
What this story about? - Derick
Yeah, I’m actually pretty curious. - Markus
That’ll have to wait until Tess gets here. - Jonny
So we won’t get to hear it? - Markus
If she doesn’t come, whose fucking fault do you think that is? - Jonny
Hey, calm down. Both of you. - Derick
The group sits in awkward silence for a bit. Then, Tess walks up, her jacket folded in her arms.
Hey. - Tess
Hey, Tess! You made it. What do you want? First round’s on me. - Jonny
Uh, just a coke is fine. I’m not staying for long. - Tess
Jonny’s smile fades as he mouths an ‘oh’ and leaves for the bar. Tess waits as Derick scoots over, and then sits down in the booth. 
Hey. Long time no see. - Markus
Tess frowns.
Right. What have you been up to? - Markus
Just working some shifts. The rest of the time fills up. Same old. - Tess
Still at the special mart? - Derick
Yeah, and some other places, too. You know that diner outside of town? - Tess
The one with the great pancakes? Of course. - Derick
Figures, haha. - Tess
You waitressing then, now? - Derick
Nah, the woman who runs the place doesn’t trust me with customers yet. I’m in the back, prepping the delivery orders. - Tess
They still deliver? Damn, I thought that was a temporary thing. - Derick
Pretty nice cashflow, so yeah. - Tess
Sounds like a decent job. - Derick
It’s all right. How’re your classes? - Tess
Pretty tough, all things considered. I actually have a class with Markus now. - Derick
Huh? Oh, right. It’s rough, but funny stuff happens, too. A few days ago--- - Markus
Jonny sets down a coke in front of Tess, and a beer in front of Markus. Markus lifts an eyebrow, but Jonny then motions him to scoot over. Markus does, and Jonny joins them.
Yeah, yeah. You sit down next to some girl and start talking to her thinking she’s Tess. Enough of your stories. Time to tell of my exploits. - Jonny
Wait, what? - Tess
Dude, that’s not the story I was going to--- - Markus
This afternoon, I, Jonny, conqueror of maidens, deliverer of maternal instincts, went on a date. - Jonny
I sure hope that wasn’t your introduction to her. - Derick
No, those titles still need some work. - Jonny
Deliverer of maternal instincts? Big yikes, dude. - Derick
Anyway, as I told Tess this morning, I met her in class, but she lives here, too. - Jonny
Wow, that’s... unlikely. Do we know her? - Derick
No, she had pretty alternative schooling up to college. - Jonny
Alternative. Sounds like a euphemism. - Derick
Just shut up and let me tell the story. - Jonny
We met at the BrainSplat coffee place. I was running a little late, but was only late for being early, so everything was all right. She was already there, looking out the window with dreamy eyes. I walked up, asking if she’d waited long. Immediately, she cracked a joke about Chronocops. A time travel joke! So I quipped one back, and we were both laughing our asses off. By the time they came to take our order, we were already talking about everything that was wrong with season 2. - Jonny
Wow. - Derick
Hahah. Typical you’d dream about a girl, not with the ‘perfect’ figure, or a kind personality, but one you can bitch with about your tv shows. - Tess
Oh, she’s kind. And she’s a looker, too. Here, I’ll show you. - Jonny
But that makes me wonder. If that surprised you, how come you’d even invited her on the date. Didn’t you know her from class? - Derick
Ooh, very sharp, Derick. If you didn’t know she was a nerd, you wouldn’t have had the guts to ask her out. How did that happen? - Tess
Perhaps just a rare success story for this determined boy right here. - Jonny
You’re asking me to believe in miracles here. - Derick
Yup. I’m not buying it. You can distract yourself with your phone all you want, I can tell by your face that you’re covering something up. - Tess
Why can’t you guys just believe in me? Would it really be so hard to believe that I didn’t screw it up this one time? - Jonny
Oh, we believe in you, all right. - Tess
Hmhmm. In your consistency. - Derick
Hahah. Well crap. You’ve got me. It’s actually a little embarrassing, so I was hoping not to tell you. Oh, I’ve got the picture, right here! - Jonny
The three of them leaned over to look at the picture, showing a pretty redheaded girl. Tess’ eyes darted up to the top of the screen, where she saw the time. 
She’s pretty---shit! - Tess
What?! - Jonny
Oh, no. Not like that. She’s pretty. I’m late. - Tess
Oh. Oh, so you like her? - Jonny
Tess hurried grabs her jacket, putting it on as she stands up. 
Yeah, she looks cool. I would say bring her over some time, but just focus on not fucking this up for now. - Tess
Yeah! Wait... - Jonny
Oh, and you still owe me that embarrassing story! - Tess
As Tess finishes, she shoots a wink and a fingergun at Jonny, before passing through the door. Jonny turns to the others and smiles widely. 
Happy? - Derick
Yup. I just got confirmation from an objective party. I’m dating a hot nerd. - Jonny
I would hardly call Tess objective. Also, are you guys officially going out now? - Derick
Official smomishle. I like her, she likes me. That’s what matters. Right Markus? - Jonny
Huh? Oh, I’d be careful if I were you. Girls tend to find that official side of things important. - Markus
Really? Oh man... - Jonny
Are you all right, Markus? - Derick
I’m okay. It’s just... Why’d you have to tell her about that thing in class, Jonny? - Markus
You were just telling her that story. I thought I’d skip the nonsense and get to my story. - Jonny
I wasn’t going to tell her that. That was between us three. *Sigh* shit. - Markus
I---I didn’t realise. Sorry, man. - Jonny
That was a dumb thing to do, Jonny. - Derick
Sorry... It didn’t seem like she minded, though. If that helps. - Jonny
Oh, she minded. She just isn’t the type to let it show. - Markus
You might be overthinking this, Markus. - Derick
She’s already icing me out. This is just great. - Markus
Why did it even happen, though? In class. - Jonny
Fuck if I know! *Sigh* I’m off. - Markus
Markus. - Derick
Markus gets out of the booth, pushing past Jonny and leaves the bar.
Jeez. Ass. - Jonny
Dude. - Derick
I know. - Jonny
