You’re late. Why are you late? - Aunt Erin

Tess walks into the house, greeted by a group of her aunt’s friends. She dusts off her shoes before stepping in.

It’s all right, Erin. Joseph isn’t even here yet, the bastard. - Russell

He’ll probably play it off like he thought we were meeting at the place. That’s what he usually does on game nights. - Sandra

I think I saw him at Ventley’s, actually. - Tess

Really? - Jackie

Oh, you mean the place he suggested we meet at so he could watch the game? Surprising. - Sandra

What a guy, haha. - Russell

That’s where you were off to? The bar? Grabbing a quick drink before you’re forced to hang out with your cute little niece? - Aunt Erin

Like I’d ever want to numb myself for that. - Tess

Implying you do numb yourself for other things. - Russell

An ‘Ooh!’, followed by knowing looks towards Tess. Tess looks away and rolls her eyes.

Did you drink anything, though? - Aunt Erin

Just a coke---that I didn’t even touch. Damn, missed out on a free drink. - Tess

We have coke in the fridge. Just don’t give Hannah too much. - Aunt Erin

We’ll be fine, Erin. You guys go. Sorry I was late. - Tess

Russell’s phone rings. He looks at the screen and then raises a finger as if to say ‘now watch’. 

Hey, Joseph. Where have been? We’ve been waiting for a while. Hm. Hmhmm. Oh, so you thought we were meeting at the place itself? - Russell

Russell raises a hand at Sandra, who high fives him. 

No, that’s fine. We’ll head over now. By the way, what was the final score? You don’t say. - Russell

Aunt Erin rolls her eyes looking at Tess, who smiles back. The friendship in this group was enviable, and not to mention old. The roots trace back to elementary school. That’s good mileage. 

Aunt Erin yells she’s leaving to Hannah, who comes down to give her mother a hug. 
Got any fun plans for tonight? - Aunt Erin

She adds, looking at Tess:

No more horror movies. - Aunt Erin

Tess is taking me to the cinema. There’s this new really bad teen romance movie. We’re going to trash it. - Hannah

You girls have the weirdest taste in movies. Well, have fun tonight. - Aunt Erin

You too. - Tess

Don’t forget to lock the doors. - Aunt Erin

The door closes as the company leaves. The two girls look at each other and smile.
