Dude, you are so done for! - Jonny

The table is filled with all kinds of stacks of playing cards. Across from Jonny is Derick, holding up a hand of cards that is considerably smaller than Jonny’s.

Are you sure? ‘Cause I think I’m winning next turn. - Derick

Wipe that smug grin off your face, big guy. - Jonny

With a wicked grin, Jonny slams a card onto the largest pile of cards in the middle of the table. Jonny keeps looking at Derick, but Derick just grins back, startling Jonny.

No, you don’t actually have... - Jonny

Hehe. - Derick

Derick places one of his own cards on the same pile, waiting for a response from Jonny that he knew wouldn’t come.

You are---Your luck is--- - Jonny

Derick points at the card and raises his eyebrows at Jonny, prompting a response to his play.

Fine! You win. No response. Go ahead. - Jonny

Derick places his last two cards on a smaller stack in front of him, leaving him with no cards left in hand. With a smug smile he scoops up all the card piles and starts shuffling them.

So that’s a round on you, right? - Derick

Yeah, yeah. Just a beer? - Jonny

Give me a Mojito. - Derick

... Seriously? - Jonny

I’m feeling fancy tonight. - Derick

Jonny clicks his tongue disapprovingly, but stands up from the pub couch and stomps over to the bar. Soon after, the bar doors open up and Markus enters, looking around until he sees Derick.

Hey, man. Sorry I’m late. - Markus

Markus throws off his coat and sits down across from Derick.

That’s alright. Where have you been? - Derick

Ah. I was at Erik’s. Watching the game. - Markus

Markus looks uncomfortable saying that, reaching for a beer that isn’t there yet.

You. Watching the game. - Derick

Yeah, I found out it’s actually pretty entertaining, I guess. - Markus

Hmm. Changed your mind from when we watched one together, then? - Derick

Right. Yes. Actually no. I can’t lie to you. I hate it. But my girlfriend’s friends do like it, and I 
want to relate, you know? - Markus

Yeah, sure. You want to be able to join their conversations. - Derick

Yes! Exactly. - Markus

Even if they bore you to no end. - Derick

They don’t really bore me to--- - Markus

Your words. - Derick

Right, that’s true. But that was ages ago. - Markus

A month back. - Derick

Alright, alright. I get it. Sorry. - Derick

Don’t get me wrong, dude. I don’t mind. You probably shouldn’t lie to yourself, though. Doesn’t work out well, usually. - Derick

Markus nods thoughtfully. Then, he gets up to get a beer. He turns before he walks off.

You know, you’re pretty wise sometimes. For a Rockfeller. - Markus

Thank my mom for that. - Derick

They exchange grins, then Markus walks off to the bar.
