A flash of light blinds the entirety of the crew, as it reveals an unwanted new sight on the horizon. Galaxer’s dread-fleet. - Markus

Jonny, Derick and Tess all groan in unison.

Great. Because you two kept bickering about which rebel system had the best fastfood, we’re going to get eaten by Galaxer’s prize mutts. - Tess

I still think Jarus IV was the right choice. - Jonny

Jonny and Derick bicker briefly before Markus continues.

As the crew is caught up in petty squabbles, the fleet slowly advances. The scanners are picking up several fighter squadrons moving into strike range, quickly. Even as you bicker, you can hear the muffled protests of the Emperor’s daughter rolling about in the cargo room. What do you do? - Markus

Shit. He’s not going to let us off the hook, will he? - Derick

Oh, I don’t know. Would you let a group of rebel mercenaries who killed an entire garrison. - Jonny

I mean, I’m no galactic emperor, but--- - Derick

Derick is interrupted by a slap from Tess.

Shut up and just get this ship moving. We’re going to have to evade them in this system before we jump, or they’ll track us. I head to the main gun turret, Markus. - Tess

The other two nod in agreement.

As you put the ship back into order to run from the scene, your holodeck activates with an incoming signal. A tall, half robotic man wearing a long dark red uniform appears in the centre of the cabin. - Markus

Great. Anybody got a decent diplomacy skill? - Jonny

We don’t need a diplomacy skill for this. - Darick

Surrender whilst you still can, rebel scum. We have your signal tracked and you’re being surrounded as we speak. If you... - Marcus

I pull the plug on the holodeck. - Darick

The rest looks at each other dumbfounded.

Well, I guess that’s one way to do it. - Jonny

A few moments after the tall hologram disappears, the first ships breach the ships firing range. Having set up shop in the main turret, what do you do, Tess? - Markus

I start blasting any ship that is headed directly for us. - Tess

Hold up, we can’t outgun that fleet. Are you trying to get us killed?! - Jonny

Right, because they probably just flew this way to talk this over. Besides, they won’t shoot as long as we have the princess aboard. - Tess

Jonny struggles to reason against this, as Markus turns to Derick.

The engines are warming up. Where to, captain? - Markus

Jonny and Tess look at Derick expectantly. Derick pauses for a moment, and then searches through his folder, spilling all kinds of handouts over the table. He grabs one, a star map with a long list of system names.

We’ll lose them in the asteroid field around the blown up moon. Then we’ll jump to Baricus XI. - Derick

Aww, come on - Jonny

It’s just the closest unaffiliated system, that’s all. - Derick

Jonny complains some more, but Tess shuts him up. 

All right, sounds good. You start to move your small gunship...  - Markus

It’s called the SS Ination. - Jonny

Had we settled on that? If not, I’d like to hold off on a name like that until we’re no longer being chased by desperate Imperial loyalists trying to save their one chance for a legacy. - Tess

Markus laughs and continues.

Right, of course. The SS Ination, or whichever name you prefer, starts making its way towards the nearby rubble field surrounding the broken moon. The first ships have entered your firing range, roll a gun turret attack if you will, Tess. Derick, in a sec you can roll a piloting check for entering the rubble field, so keep those numbers ready. - Markus

All right, some actual fighting! - Jonny

As Jonny calls this out, some of the other pub goers look around for signs of a fight breaking out, only to frown at the dice and papers over on the group’s table.

If that’s what you call actual fighting, you better hope you don’t get drafted, boy. - Frank

Oh zip it Frank. Go back to watching some people play a game you’re too old to play yourself. - Jonny

At least I could play it at some point in my life, pipsqueak. - Frank

As Jonny gets fired up and turns to Frank to insult him some more, he knocks over Tess’ drink. The beer spills over some of the papers before Derick, Tess, and Markus can clear the table. 

Oh, shit. Sorry Tess. - Jonny

You fucking idiot. - Tess

Tess slaps Jonny on the back of his head.

Haha, I can tell why you prefer pretend fighting over the real thing, boy. - Frank

Argh. I’ll go get a towel or something. - Jonny

Here, take this. - Bart

Bart says, reaching over past Frank to throw a towel onto the wet table. 

Ah, thanks. - Jonny

Well... - Derick

Derick holds up a soaked character sheet. Jonny looks dejectedly at his feet.

Sorry, man. - Jonny

That’s okay, it was time for a new one anyway. I could hardly erase the pencil lines from my health because of the wear. - Derick

You do often take the brunt of it. - Markus

They laugh it off.

As the table gets cleaned, or at least dried off a bit, Markus continues. 

So, what’d you roll for the attack, Tess? - Markus

What? Oh, pretty low, so I’m pretty sure I missed. - Tess

The turret lets loose the first volley of shots at the Imperial fighters, but you immediately notice these aren’t your everyday pilots. They skilfully dodge your shots and approach the ship. - Markus

At least try to keep them at a distance, they won’t kill us but they will track us if they get the chance. - Jonny

Right as you communicate that over the radio, a flash of light comes streaking towards the ship. - Markus

What?! - Tess and Jonny in unison

Markus picks up some dice and rolls them, referencing some papers.

An instant later, the light cascades into a rainbow of colours as the laser hits the ship’s shields. - Markus

So much for them not killing us. I start some evasive manoeuvres. - Derick

That makes no sense! They know we have the princess on board. - Tess

Unless... Damn, what is that Galaxer planning? Does he want to kill his only heir? - Jonny

Oh my god, that’s it. There must be another heir. He doesn’t mind killing her if it kills us, too. - Tess

I guess it’s possible we missed one. - Derick

There wasn’t even a file on this heir in the Empire’s archives! How is there another layer of secrecy? - Jonny

Galaxer’s a sly bastard, that’s for sure. Wow. - Tess

Now I feel kind of bad for this lady. - Derick

Ah, right. Yeah, sucks to be her. - Jonny

Imperial scum is imperial scum. - Tess

Didn’t this planet just rebel against the Empire? - Derick

Derick, give me a piloting roll for those manoeuvres. It’ll be tough, as you’re reaching the edge of the rubble field. Debris litters the space around you. - Markus

Hmph. That’s not the best, but my piloting skill applies, right? - Derick 

How much could that possibly be? - Jonny

Plus sixteen. - Derick

Jonny and Tess stare at Derick for a second, before exclaiming their surprise.

How the hell did you get such a big bonus? What skills did you choose since the last time we played? - Tess

I’d show you my build, but... - Derick

Derick holds up his still damp and ruined character sheet.

You succeed in shaking the attacks from the fighters as you fly further into the rubble belt. The fighters behind you don’t follow as soon as the rubble starts getting denser, but instead split up and circle the outskirts of the rubble belt. If you keep up the fast pace, you’ll have to roll to avoid smashing into the rubble parts. - Markus

That’s fine, I’ll slow down. - Derick

Slowly, you retreat further and further back into the chaos of the rubble belt. You radar shows you more and more ships spreading out, surrounding the area. From further back, between the rocks and salvage flying around, you can see one of the destroyer ships moving steadily towards the moon. - Markus

We have to lose them quickly, we can never escape the destroyer’s radar in this garbage. - Jonny

Great. So it’s ‘get smashed by space rubble’, ‘get shot by Imperial fighters’ or ‘hide and get blasted by a destroyer torpedo’. Anybody got any smart ideas? - Tess

Derick and Jonny exchange glances, and start searching through their sheets for an answer. Markus stands up, grabbing the empty mugs. 

I’ll go and grab some more drinks whilst you scramble in the face of your inevitable demise. - Markus

Oh, we’ll get that bastard Galaxer. Somehow. - Jonny

A triple for me. - Tess

This might be a problem. We don’t have a lot of fuel left for fancy manoeuvres, if we want to get to another planet in the system before jumping, that is. - Derick

Oh, we’ve got a problem alright. - Tess

No, I think I’ve got a plan. If we route most of our power to--- - Jonny

Tess points at the bar, where Markus is approached by a short blond girl. With her band t-shirt she couldn’t even name a song of herself, she laughs and twirls her hair as she talks to Markus.

Is that Debbie? - Derick

Ah, fuck. - Jonny

Guess we know who wins tonight. - Tess

Markus is taken by the arm and dragged to Debbie’s table. They watch for a moment as Markus gets a seat in the far corner of the nook, and a drink is shoved his way. The group starts talking and laughing it off as they read questions off small cards. Markus soon laughs with them. Tess grabs Derick’s beer and chugs the last quarter of it.

She cucked us. - Tess

Are you serious? The how-manieth time is this that we get ditched in the middle of a session like this? - Jonny

He’ll be back. - Derick

To tell us he’s sorry and grab his coat, yeah. He needs to grow some balls and stand up to her. - Jonny

Markus is a good guy. He said he felt guilty when this happens. - Derick

And yet, here we are. - Jonny

Tess stands up and puts on her jacket.

I’m not waiting half an hour to get ditched again. - Tess

Aw, Tess, come on. At least stay and get drunk with us. It’s a Friday night. - Jonny

You still need a ride, Tess? - Derick

No, it’s fine. I’ll walk. - Tess

Really? Not you too, Tess. - Jonny

See you guys next ditch session. - Tess

Tess exits the pub into the cold spring weather. She looks at the motorcycles in front of the building with envy, before lighting a cigarette. After a single puff, she throws it away, cursing the nicotine free cigarettes. 
It’s still pretty early, around midnight. The small town is still pretty lively, but not on the streets. Tess walks home through the cold, entering her aunt’s place quietly. She is surprised to see her 14 year old niece and her friend still awake on the couch.

Hey Tess! - Sam (friend)

Oh, hey Tess. You’re back early. - Hannah (niece)

Sure am. Blame Markus. What are you watching? - Tess

Tess plops down on the couch in between the two. The girls share the blanket and a can of coke with Tess.

A horror movie. - Hannah

Which one? - Tess

That one with the nurse you recommended. - Sam

I’m pretty sure I never told you guys to watch it. - Tess

No, but you talked about it on the phone. - Sam

Okay, maybe we need to talk about you stalking my aunt. - Hannah

What? No, I’m not stalking her, I just overheard... - Sam

Sam and Hannah get spooked by a jump scare in the movie. Tess laughs.

Oh yeah. This movie is so bad, it’s great. - Tess

They sit watching the movie for a bit.

Don’t you have work tomorrow morning? - Sam

What did I just say? - Hannah

No! I--- - Sam

Haha, well I’d planned on being back from the pub a little later than this, so I’m still fine. Thanks for the trust, though. - Tess

I didn’t mean to---obviously you knew, but--- - Sam

Tess laughs and pets Sam’s head.

She’s cute. - Tess

Sam gets quiet and retreats under the blankets.

Don’t feed it. I’m trying to condition her to stop. - Hannah

I bet the boys love it. Are you jealous? - Tess

It’s not all about boys. - Hannah

If you say so. Ooh, wait look closely here. - Tess

Tess points at the screen and the girls look closely. A jump-scare sends them screaming under the blankets, and Tess laughs.
