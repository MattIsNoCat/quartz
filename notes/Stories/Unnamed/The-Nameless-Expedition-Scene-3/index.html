I told her to come. - Jonny</p><p>Jonny takes a sip from his drink as Markus sets the other two glasses down on the table and takes a seat.</p><p>Weâ€™re lucky you words are basically commandments to women. - Derick</p><p>Shut up. Besides, itâ€™s Tess. My success with women doesnâ€™t apply to her. - Jonny</p><p>Are you calling her easy? - Derick</p><p>Dude, chill with the witch hunt. Itâ€™s not a girl, itâ€™s Tess. And Iâ€™ll have you know, after what Iâ€™ll tell you tonight, youâ€™ll think differently about my experience with women. Iâ€™m no longer that awkward boy from high school. - Jonny</p><p>Youâ€™re absolutely right, Jonny. Youâ€™re at least two inches taller now. - Markus</p><p>Jonny sigh as hard as he could, and the other two laugh it off.</p><p>What this story about? - Derick</p><p>Yeah, Iâ€™m actually pretty curious. - Markus</p><p>Thatâ€™ll have to wait until Tess gets here. - Jonny</p><p>So we wonâ€™t get to hear it? - Markus</p><p>If she doesnâ€™t come, whose fucking fault do you think that is? - Jonny</p><p>Hey, calm down. Both of you. - Derick</p><p>The group sits in awkward silence for a bit. Then, Tess walks up, her jacket folded in her arms.</p><p>Hey. - Tess</p><p>Hey, Tess! You made it. What do you want? First roundâ€™s on me. - Jonny</p><p>Uh, just a coke is fine. Iâ€™m not staying for long. - Tess</p><p>Jonnyâ€™s smile fades as he mouths an â€˜ohâ€™ and leaves for the bar. Tess waits as Derick scoots over, and then sits down in the booth.</p><p>Hey. Long time no see. - Markus</p><p>Tess frowns.</p><p>Right. What have you been up to? - Markus</p><p>Just working some shifts. The rest of the time fills up. Same old. - Tess</p><p>Still at the special mart? - Derick</p><p>Yeah, and some other places, too. You know that diner outside of town? - Tess</p><p>The one with the great pancakes? Of course. - Derick</p><p>Figures, haha. - Tess</p><p>You waitressing then, now? - Derick</p><p>Nah, the woman who runs the place doesnâ€™t trust me with customers yet. Iâ€™m in the back, prepping the delivery orders. - Tess</p><p>They still deliver? Damn, I thought that was a temporary thing. - Derick</p><p>Pretty nice cashflow, so yeah. - Tess</p><p>Sounds like a decent job. - Derick</p><p>Itâ€™s all right. Howâ€™re your classes? - Tess</p><p>Pretty tough, all things considered. I actually have a class with Markus now. - Derick</p><p>Huh? Oh, right. Itâ€™s rough, but funny stuff happens, too. A few days ago&mdash; - Markus</p><p>Jonny sets down a coke in front of Tess, and a beer in front of Markus. Markus lifts an eyebrow, but Jonny then motions him to scoot over. Markus does, and Jonny joins them.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. You sit down next to some girl and start talking to her thinking sheâ€™s Tess. Enough of your stories. Time to tell of my exploits. - Jonny</p><p>Wait, what? - Tess</p><p>Dude, thatâ€™s not the story I was going to&mdash; - Markus</p><p>This afternoon, I, Jonny, conqueror of maidens, deliverer of maternal instincts, went on a date. - Jonny</p><p>I sure hope that wasnâ€™t your introduction to her. - Derick</p><p>No, those titles still need some work. - Jonny</p><p>Deliverer of maternal instincts? Big yikes, dude. - Derick</p><p>Anyway, as I told Tess this morning, I met her in class, but she lives here, too. - Jonny</p><p>Wow, thatâ€™s&mldr; unlikely. Do we know her? - Derick</p><p>No, she had pretty alternative schooling up to college. - Jonny</p><p>Alternative. Sounds like a euphemism. - Derick</p><p>Just shut up and let me tell the story. - Jonny</p><p>We met at the BrainSplat coffee place. I was running a little late, but was only late for being early, so everything was all right. She was already there, looking out the window with dreamy eyes. I walked up, asking if sheâ€™d waited long. Immediately, she cracked a joke about Chronocops. A time travel joke! So I quipped one back, and we were both laughing our asses off. By the time they came to take our order, we were already talking about everything that was wrong with season 2. - Jonny</p><p>Wow. - Derick</p><p>Hahah. Typical youâ€™d dream about a girl, not with the â€˜perfectâ€™ figure, or a kind personality, but one you can bitch with about your tv shows. - Tess</p><p>Oh, sheâ€™s kind. And sheâ€™s a looker, too. Here, Iâ€™ll show you. - Jonny</p><p>But that makes me wonder. If that surprised you, how come youâ€™d even invited her on the date. Didnâ€™t you know her from class? - Derick</p><p>Ooh, very sharp, Derick. If you didnâ€™t know she was a nerd, you wouldnâ€™t have had the guts to ask her out. How did that happen? - Tess</p><p>Perhaps just a rare success story for this determined boy right here. - Jonny</p><p>Youâ€™re asking me to believe in miracles here. - Derick</p><p>Yup. Iâ€™m not buying it. You can distract yourself with your phone all you want, I can tell by your face that youâ€™re covering something up. - Tess</p><p>Why canâ€™t you guys just believe in me? Would it really be so hard to believe that I didnâ€™t screw it up this one time? - Jonny</p><p>Oh, we believe in you, all right. - Tess</p><p>Hmhmm. In your consistency. - Derick</p><p>Hahah. Well crap. Youâ€™ve got me. Itâ€™s actually a little embarrassing, so I was hoping not to tell you. Oh, Iâ€™ve got the picture, right here! - Jonny</p><p>The three of them leaned over to look at the picture, showing a pretty redheaded girl. Tessâ€™ eyes darted up to the top of the screen, where she saw the time.</p><p>Sheâ€™s pretty&mdash;shit! - Tess</p><p>What?! - Jonny</p><p>Oh, no. Not like that. Sheâ€™s pretty. Iâ€™m late. - Tess</p><p>Oh. Oh, so you like her? - Jonny</p><p>Tess hurried grabs her jacket, putting it on as she stands up.</p><p>Yeah, she looks cool. I would say bring her over some time, but just focus on not fucking this up for now. - Tess</p><p>Yeah! Wait&mldr; - Jonny</p><p>Oh, and you still owe me that embarrassing story! - Tess</p><p>As Tess finishes, she shoots a wink and a fingergun at Jonny, before passing through the door. Jonny turns to the others and smiles widely.</p><p>Happy? - Derick</p><p>Yup. I just got confirmation from an objective party. Iâ€™m dating a hot nerd. - Jonny</p><p>I would hardly call Tess objective. Also, are you guys officially going out now? - Derick</p><p>Official smomishle. I like her, she likes me. Thatâ€™s what matters. Right Markus? - Jonny</p><p>Huh? Oh, Iâ€™d be careful if I were you. Girls tend to find that official side of things important. - Markus</p><p>Really? Oh man&mldr; - Jonny</p><p>Are you all right, Markus? - Derick</p><p>Iâ€™m okay. Itâ€™s just&mldr; Whyâ€™d you have to tell her about that thing in class, Jonny? - Markus</p><p>You were just telling her that story. I thought Iâ€™d skip the nonsense and get to my story. - Jonny</p><p>I wasnâ€™t going to tell her that. That was between us three. <em>Sigh</em> shit. - Markus</p><p>I&mdash;I didnâ€™t realise. Sorry, man. - Jonny</p><p>That was a dumb thing to do, Jonny. - Derick</p><p>Sorry&mldr; It didnâ€™t seem like she minded, though. If that helps. - Jonny</p><p>Oh, she minded. She just isnâ€™t the type to let it show. - Markus</p><p>You might be overthinking this, Markus. - Derick</p><p>Sheâ€™s already icing me out. This is just great. - Markus</p><p>Why did it even happen, though? In class. - Jonny</p><p>Fuck if I know! <em>Sigh</em> Iâ€™m off. - Markus</p><p>Markus. - Derick</p><p>Markus gets out of the booth, pushing past Jonny and leaves the bar.</p><p>Jeez. Ass. - Jonny</p><p>Dude. - Derick</p><p>I know. - Jonny</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://mattisnocat.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Matt West using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://mattisnocat.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
