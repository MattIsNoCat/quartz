Galaxerâ€™s dread-fleet. - Markus</p><p>Jonny, Derick and Tess all groan in unison.</p><p>Great. Because you two kept bickering about which rebel system had the best fastfood, weâ€™re going to get eaten by Galaxerâ€™s prize mutts. - Tess</p><p>I still think Jarus IV was the right choice. - Jonny</p><p>Jonny and Derick bicker briefly before Markus continues.</p><p>As the crew is caught up in petty squabbles, the fleet slowly advances. The scanners are picking up several fighter squadrons moving into strike range, quickly. Even as you bicker, you can hear the muffled protests of the Emperorâ€™s daughter rolling about in the cargo room. What do you do? - Markus</p><p>Shit. Heâ€™s not going to let us off the hook, will he? - Derick</p><p>Oh, I donâ€™t know. Would you let a group of rebel mercenaries who killed an entire garrison. - Jonny</p><p>I mean, Iâ€™m no galactic emperor, but&mdash; - Derick</p><p>Derick is interrupted by a slap from Tess.</p><p>Shut up and just get this ship moving. Weâ€™re going to have to evade them in this system before we jump, or theyâ€™ll track us. I head to the main gun turret, Markus. - Tess</p><p>The other two nod in agreement.</p><p>As you put the ship back into order to run from the scene, your holodeck activates with an incoming signal. A tall, half robotic man wearing a long dark red uniform appears in the centre of the cabin. - Markus</p><p>Great. Anybody got a decent diplomacy skill? - Jonny</p><p>We donâ€™t need a diplomacy skill for this. - Darick</p><p>Surrender whilst you still can, rebel scum. We have your signal tracked and youâ€™re being surrounded as we speak. If you&mldr; - Marcus</p><p>I pull the plug on the holodeck. - Darick</p><p>The rest looks at each other dumbfounded.</p><p>Well, I guess thatâ€™s one way to do it. - Jonny</p><p>A few moments after the tall hologram disappears, the first ships breach the ships firing range. Having set up shop in the main turret, what do you do, Tess? - Markus</p><p>I start blasting any ship that is headed directly for us. - Tess</p><p>Hold up, we canâ€™t outgun that fleet. Are you trying to get us killed?! - Jonny</p><p>Right, because they probably just flew this way to talk this over. Besides, they wonâ€™t shoot as long as we have the princess aboard. - Tess</p><p>Jonny struggles to reason against this, as Markus turns to Derick.</p><p>The engines are warming up. Where to, captain? - Markus</p><p>Jonny and Tess look at Derick expectantly. Derick pauses for a moment, and then searches through his folder, spilling all kinds of handouts over the table. He grabs one, a star map with a long list of system names.</p><p>Weâ€™ll lose them in the asteroid field around the blown up moon. Then weâ€™ll jump to Baricus XI. - Derick</p><p>Aww, come on - Jonny</p><p>Itâ€™s just the closest unaffiliated system, thatâ€™s all. - Derick</p><p>Jonny complains some more, but Tess shuts him up.</p><p>All right, sounds good. You start to move your small gunship&mldr; - Markus</p><p>Itâ€™s called the SS Ination. - Jonny</p><p>Had we settled on that? If not, Iâ€™d like to hold off on a name like that until weâ€™re no longer being chased by desperate Imperial loyalists trying to save their one chance for a legacy. - Tess</p><p>Markus laughs and continues.</p><p>Right, of course. The SS Ination, or whichever name you prefer, starts making its way towards the nearby rubble field surrounding the broken moon. The first ships have entered your firing range, roll a gun turret attack if you will, Tess. Derick, in a sec you can roll a piloting check for entering the rubble field, so keep those numbers ready. - Markus</p><p>All right, some actual fighting! - Jonny</p><p>As Jonny calls this out, some of the other pub goers look around for signs of a fight breaking out, only to frown at the dice and papers over on the groupâ€™s table.</p><p>If thatâ€™s what you call actual fighting, you better hope you donâ€™t get drafted, boy. - Frank</p><p>Oh zip it Frank. Go back to watching some people play a game youâ€™re too old to play yourself. - Jonny</p><p>At least I could play it at some point in my life, pipsqueak. - Frank</p><p>As Jonny gets fired up and turns to Frank to insult him some more, he knocks over Tessâ€™ drink. The beer spills over some of the papers before Derick, Tess, and Markus can clear the table.</p><p>Oh, shit. Sorry Tess. - Jonny</p><p>You fucking idiot. - Tess</p><p>Tess slaps Jonny on the back of his head.</p><p>Haha, I can tell why you prefer pretend fighting over the real thing, boy. - Frank</p><p>Argh. Iâ€™ll go get a towel or something. - Jonny</p><p>Here, take this. - Bart</p><p>Bart says, reaching over past Frank to throw a towel onto the wet table.</p><p>Ah, thanks. - Jonny</p><p>Well&mldr; - Derick</p><p>Derick holds up a soaked character sheet. Jonny looks dejectedly at his feet.</p><p>Sorry, man. - Jonny</p><p>Thatâ€™s okay, it was time for a new one anyway. I could hardly erase the pencil lines from my health because of the wear. - Derick</p><p>You do often take the brunt of it. - Markus</p><p>They laugh it off.</p><p>As the table gets cleaned, or at least dried off a bit, Markus continues.</p><p>So, whatâ€™d you roll for the attack, Tess? - Markus</p><p>What? Oh, pretty low, so Iâ€™m pretty sure I missed. - Tess</p><p>The turret lets loose the first volley of shots at the Imperial fighters, but you immediately notice these arenâ€™t your everyday pilots. They skilfully dodge your shots and approach the ship. - Markus</p><p>At least try to keep them at a distance, they wonâ€™t kill us but they will track us if they get the chance. - Jonny</p><p>Right as you communicate that over the radio, a flash of light comes streaking towards the ship. - Markus</p><p>What?! - Tess and Jonny in unison</p><p>Markus picks up some dice and rolls them, referencing some papers.</p><p>An instant later, the light cascades into a rainbow of colours as the laser hits the shipâ€™s shields. - Markus</p><p>So much for them not killing us. I start some evasive manoeuvres. - Derick</p><p>That makes no sense! They know we have the princess on board. - Tess</p><p>Unless&mldr; Damn, what is that Galaxer planning? Does he want to kill his only heir? - Jonny</p><p>Oh my god, thatâ€™s it. There must be another heir. He doesnâ€™t mind killing her if it kills us, too. - Tess</p><p>I guess itâ€™s possible we missed one. - Derick</p><p>There wasnâ€™t even a file on this heir in the Empireâ€™s archives! How is there another layer of secrecy? - Jonny</p><p>Galaxerâ€™s a sly bastard, thatâ€™s for sure. Wow. - Tess</p><p>Now I feel kind of bad for this lady. - Derick</p><p>Ah, right. Yeah, sucks to be her. - Jonny</p><p>Imperial scum is imperial scum. - Tess</p><p>Didnâ€™t this planet just rebel against the Empire? - Derick</p><p>Derick, give me a piloting roll for those manoeuvres. Itâ€™ll be tough, as youâ€™re reaching the edge of the rubble field. Debris litters the space around you. - Markus</p><p>Hmph. Thatâ€™s not the best, but my piloting skill applies, right? - Derick</p><p>How much could that possibly be? - Jonny</p><p>Plus sixteen. - Derick</p><p>Jonny and Tess stare at Derick for a second, before exclaiming their surprise.</p><p>How the hell did you get such a big bonus? What skills did you choose since the last time we played? - Tess</p><p>Iâ€™d show you my build, but&mldr; - Derick</p><p>Derick holds up his still damp and ruined character sheet.</p><p>You succeed in shaking the attacks from the fighters as you fly further into the rubble belt. The fighters behind you donâ€™t follow as soon as the rubble starts getting denser, but instead split up and circle the outskirts of the rubble belt. If you keep up the fast pace, youâ€™ll have to roll to avoid smashing into the rubble parts. - Markus</p><p>Thatâ€™s fine, Iâ€™ll slow down. - Derick</p><p>Slowly, you retreat further and further back into the chaos of the rubble belt. You radar shows you more and more ships spreading out, surrounding the area. From further back, between the rocks and salvage flying around, you can see one of the destroyer ships moving steadily towards the moon. - Markus</p><p>We have to lose them quickly, we can never escape the destroyerâ€™s radar in this garbage. - Jonny</p><p>Great. So itâ€™s â€˜get smashed by space rubbleâ€™, â€˜get shot by Imperial fightersâ€™ or â€˜hide and get blasted by a destroyer torpedoâ€™. Anybody got any smart ideas? - Tess</p><p>Derick and Jonny exchange glances, and start searching through their sheets for an answer. Markus stands up, grabbing the empty mugs.</p><p>Iâ€™ll go and grab some more drinks whilst you scramble in the face of your inevitable demise. - Markus</p><p>Oh, weâ€™ll get that bastard Galaxer. Somehow. - Jonny</p><p>A triple for me. - Tess</p><p>This might be a problem. We donâ€™t have a lot of fuel left for fancy manoeuvres, if we want to get to another planet in the system before jumping, that is. - Derick</p><p>Oh, weâ€™ve got a problem alright. - Tess</p><p>No, I think Iâ€™ve got a plan. If we route most of our power to&mdash; - Jonny</p><p>Tess points at the bar, where Markus is approached by a short blond girl. With her band t-shirt she couldnâ€™t even name a song of herself, she laughs and twirls her hair as she talks to Markus.</p><p>Is that Debbie? - Derick</p><p>Ah, fuck. - Jonny</p><p>Guess we know who wins tonight. - Tess</p><p>Markus is taken by the arm and dragged to Debbieâ€™s table. They watch for a moment as Markus gets a seat in the far corner of the nook, and a drink is shoved his way. The group starts talking and laughing it off as they read questions off small cards. Markus soon laughs with them. Tess grabs Derickâ€™s beer and chugs the last quarter of it.</p><p>She cucked us. - Tess</p><p>Are you serious? The how-manieth time is this that we get ditched in the middle of a session like this? - Jonny</p><p>Heâ€™ll be back. - Derick</p><p>To tell us heâ€™s sorry and grab his coat, yeah. He needs to grow some balls and stand up to her. - Jonny</p><p>Markus is a good guy. He said he felt guilty when this happens. - Derick</p><p>And yet, here we are. - Jonny</p><p>Tess stands up and puts on her jacket.</p><p>Iâ€™m not waiting half an hour to get ditched again. - Tess</p><p>Aw, Tess, come on. At least stay and get drunk with us. Itâ€™s a Friday night. - Jonny</p><p>You still need a ride, Tess? - Derick</p><p>No, itâ€™s fine. Iâ€™ll walk. - Tess</p><p>Really? Not you too, Tess. - Jonny</p><p>See you guys next ditch session. - Tess</p><p>Tess exits the pub into the cold spring weather. She looks at the motorcycles in front of the building with envy, before lighting a cigarette. After a single puff, she throws it away, cursing the nicotine free cigarettes.
Itâ€™s still pretty early, around midnight. The small town is still pretty lively, but not on the streets. Tess walks home through the cold, entering her auntâ€™s place quietly. She is surprised to see her 14 year old niece and her friend still awake on the couch.</p><p>Hey Tess! - Sam (friend)</p><p>Oh, hey Tess. Youâ€™re back early. - Hannah (niece)</p><p>Sure am. Blame Markus. What are you watching? - Tess</p><p>Tess plops down on the couch in between the two. The girls share the blanket and a can of coke with Tess.</p><p>A horror movie. - Hannah</p><p>Which one? - Tess</p><p>That one with the nurse you recommended. - Sam</p><p>Iâ€™m pretty sure I never told you guys to watch it. - Tess</p><p>No, but you talked about it on the phone. - Sam</p><p>Okay, maybe we need to talk about you stalking my aunt. - Hannah</p><p>What? No, Iâ€™m not stalking her, I just overheard&mldr; - Sam</p><p>Sam and Hannah get spooked by a jump scare in the movie. Tess laughs.</p><p>Oh yeah. This movie is so bad, itâ€™s great. - Tess</p><p>They sit watching the movie for a bit.</p><p>Donâ€™t you have work tomorrow morning? - Sam</p><p>What did I just say? - Hannah</p><p>No! I&mdash; - Sam</p><p>Haha, well Iâ€™d planned on being back from the pub a little later than this, so Iâ€™m still fine. Thanks for the trust, though. - Tess</p><p>I didnâ€™t mean to&mdash;obviously you knew, but&mdash; - Sam</p><p>Tess laughs and pets Samâ€™s head.</p><p>Sheâ€™s cute. - Tess</p><p>Sam gets quiet and retreats under the blankets.</p><p>Donâ€™t feed it. Iâ€™m trying to condition her to stop. - Hannah</p><p>I bet the boys love it. Are you jealous? - Tess</p><p>Itâ€™s not all about boys. - Hannah</p><p>If you say so. Ooh, wait look closely here. - Tess</p><p>Tess points at the screen and the girls look closely.
