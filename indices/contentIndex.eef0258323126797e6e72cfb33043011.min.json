The term allegories gardening: seeds sprout and are tended to so that they might grow into flowers or trees. That is also what you do in a digital garden: you spread the seeds of interesting thoughts, and tend to them over time, learning as you do so. \n\nAs a means to consume, the digital garden is antithetical to the modern stream-based internet: whereas most sites nowadays are focused on a chronological feed of information, a garden is more concerned with the 'what' than the 'when'. You are free to explore a topic and its related subjects as much as you want without being bound to when it was posted. \n\nAs a means to create, the digital garden foregoes a certain performativity: it is not meant to be a perfect showing of knowledge or skill. Instead, it is focused on sharing to journey of learning and its steps. Quite often we are expected, explicitly or implicitly, to share only the best: the best picture, the best memory, the best thought. That way, the chances are higher that we impress others with our work. With a garden, you embrace being wrong. Until you are right, hopefully. \n\n## Why make one?\nPersonally\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/Judith-Butler-Gender-Performativiteit":{"title":"Judith Butler","content":"_Epistemic disclaimer: Confidence 4/10, effort 4/10. \n\nJudith Butler definieerde in haar book Gender Troubles een onderscheid tussen sekse en gender. Dit was verre van het alomvertegenwoordigde paradigma dat het tegenwoordig is, en het is mede dankzij het werk van Butler's werk dat dit de gang van zaken is nu. \n\nEen van de nogsteeds spraakmakende onderdelen van Butler's oeuvre is hun blik op gender als inherent performatief. Om dit goed te begrijpen is het belangrijk om bewust te zijn van Butler's blik: hen is een politiek filosoof, dus hun blik ligt op de maatschappelijk context meer dan de psychologische. Dat gezegd hebbende, wat betekent het om te zeggen dat gender performatief is? \n\nAlhoewel de term vaak een theatrale connotatie kent, is de performativiteit van Butler meer nauwverwant aan een linguistieke of taalfilosofische context, specifiek uit de filosofie van John Austin. In het kort is dat: taal kan constatief zijn, dat wil zeggen het omschrijft de werkelijkheid. \"Dit is een tafel, jij hebt blond haar.\" Taal kan echter ook performatief zijn, dat wil zeggen het schept de werkelijkheid; het is een actie an sich. \"(Bij een bruiloft) Ja, ik wil\". Deze performativiteit is dus een vormende, handelende kracht, en zo ziet Butler gender ook. Butler omschrijft gender als [\"een phenomeen dat ten alle tijden wordt geproduceerd en wordt gereproduceerd.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc) Daarmee ziet Butler gender dus als een iets waar mensen in sociaal-culturele context dus aanspraak op doen, in contrast tot een inherente eigenschap.\n\nHet is in die laatste opvatting van hun ideeen dat Butler kritiek kreeg vanuit queer gemeenschappen. Vele trans mensen zien of ervaren gender namelijk wel tot in zekere zin als inherent. Een pure performatieve opvatting van gender laat een gat vallen op de plek van gender dysforie: als gender puur in interactie vormgegeven wordt, hoe kunnen mensen dan een existentiele ontevredenheid voelen met hun gender ervaring? Butler is later dan ook teruggekomen om hun 'pure' performativiteit en erkent een zeker inherent component als deel van gender identiteit. Butler omschrijft henzelf ook als nonbinair in latere jaren. \n\n~~\n\n## Arcadian's toevoegingen\nWat ik interessant vind aan deze opvatting van gender performativiteit zijn de ideeen over relationele autonomie vanuit feministische en zorg-ethische filosofie. In het boek Vulnerability (Mackenzie, Rogers, \u0026 Dodds, 2014), specifiek de essay van Joel Anderson, staat een interessante opvatting van hoe een zekere mate van autonomie afhankelijk is van toelating vanuit anderen. Gender performativiteit zou hier goed inpassen: je kunt de autonomie over je eigen gender niet geheel vormen zonder medewerking van de mensen in jouw sociaal-culturele omgeving. Dat wil zeggen, jouw performatieve expressie van gender kan geblokkeerd worden door een ander, omdat gender twee kanten op gaat. Meer hier over later, ik heb hier al een andere essay over geschreven, maar lees het boek vooral!\n\n## Links and inspiration\n- Gender Trouble - Judith Butler\n- [Podcast Filosofie - Judith Butler](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CI24Rqu44cszJrakXe5el?si=6d58584e507d42ec)\n- Whipping Girl - Julia Serano\n- [Big Think - Judith Butler: Your Behavour Creates Your Gender]\n- Vulnerability: New Essays in Ethics and Feminist Philosophy - Mackenzie, Rogers, and Dodds","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/Stories/Unnamed/The-Nameless-Expedition-Filler-1":{"title":"Nameless - Filler 1","content":"Dude, you are so done for! - Jonny\n\nThe table is filled with all kinds of stacks of playing cards. Across from Jonny is Derick, holding up a hand of cards that is considerably smaller than Jonnyâ€™s.\n\nAre you sure? â€˜Cause I think Iâ€™m winning next turn. - Derick\n\nWipe that smug grin off your face, big guy. - Jonny\n\nWith a wicked grin, Jonny slams a card onto the largest pile of cards in the middle of the table. Jonny keeps looking at Derick, but Derick just grins back, startling Jonny.\n\nNo, you donâ€™t actually have... - Jonny\n\nHehe. - Derick\n\nDerick places one of his own cards on the same pile, waiting for a response from Jonny that he knew wouldnâ€™t come.\n\nYou are---Your luck is--- - Jonny\n\nDerick points at the card and raises his eyebrows at Jonny, prompting a response to his play.\n\nFine! You win. No response. Go ahead. - Jonny\n\nDerick places his last two cards on a smaller stack in front of him, leaving him with no cards left in hand. With a smug smile he scoops up all the card piles and starts shuffling them.\n\nSo thatâ€™s a round on you, right? - Derick\n\nYeah, yeah. Just a beer? - Jonny\n\nGive me a Mojito. - Derick\n\n... Seriously? - Jonny\n\nIâ€™m feeling fancy tonight. - Derick\n\nJonny clicks his tongue disapprovingly, but stands up from the pub couch and stomps over to the bar. Soon after, the bar doors open up and Markus enters, looking around until he sees Derick.\n\nHey, man. Sorry Iâ€™m late. - Markus\n\nMarkus throws off his coat and sits down across from Derick.\n\nThatâ€™s alright. Where have you been? - Derick\n\nAh. I was at Erikâ€™s. Watching the game. - Markus\n\nMarkus looks uncomfortable saying that, reaching for a beer that isnâ€™t there yet.\n\nYou. Watching the game. - Derick\n\nYeah, I found out itâ€™s actually pretty entertaining, I guess. - Markus\n\nHmm. Changed your mind from when we watched one together, then? - Derick\n\nRight. Yes. Actually no. I canâ€™t lie to you. I hate it. But my girlfriendâ€™s friends do like it, and I \nwant to relate, you know? - Markus\n\nYeah, sure. You want to be able to join their conversations. - Derick\n\nYes! Exactly. - Markus\n\nEven if they bore you to no end. - Derick\n\nThey donâ€™t really bore me to--- - Markus\n\nYour words. - Derick\n\nRight, thatâ€™s true. But that was ages ago. - Markus\n\nA month back. - Derick\n\nAlright, alright. I get it. Sorry. - Derick\n\nDonâ€™t get me wrong, dude. I donâ€™t mind. You probably shouldnâ€™t lie to yourself, though. Doesnâ€™t work out well, usually. - Derick\n\nMarkus nods thoughtfully. Then, he gets up to get a beer. He turns before he walks off.\n\nYou know, youâ€™re pretty wise sometimes. For a Rockfeller. - Markus\n\nThank my mom for that. - Derick\n\nThey exchange grins, then Markus walks off to the bar.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/Stories/Unnamed/The-Nameless-Expedition-Scene-1":{"title":"Nameless - Scene 1","content":"A flash of light blinds the entirety of the crew, as it reveals an unwanted new sight on the horizon. Galaxerâ€™s dread-fleet. - Markus\n\nJonny, Derick and Tess all groan in unison.\n\nGreat. Because you two kept bickering about which rebel system had the best fastfood, weâ€™re going to get eaten by Galaxerâ€™s prize mutts. - Tess\n\nI still think Jarus IV was the right choice. - Jonny\n\nJonny and Derick bicker briefly before Markus continues.\n\nAs the crew is caught up in petty squabbles, the fleet slowly advances. The scanners are picking up several fighter squadrons moving into strike range, quickly. Even as you bicker, you can hear the muffled protests of the Emperorâ€™s daughter rolling about in the cargo room. What do you do? - Markus\n\nShit. Heâ€™s not going to let us off the hook, will he? - Derick\n\nOh, I donâ€™t know. Would you let a group of rebel mercenaries who killed an entire garrison. - Jonny\n\nI mean, Iâ€™m no galactic emperor, but--- - Derick\n\nDerick is interrupted by a slap from Tess.\n\nShut up and just get this ship moving. Weâ€™re going to have to evade them in this system before we jump, or theyâ€™ll track us. I head to the main gun turret, Markus. - Tess\n\nThe other two nod in agreement.\n\nAs you put the ship back into order to run from the scene, your holodeck activates with an incoming signal. A tall, half robotic man wearing a long dark red uniform appears in the centre of the cabin. - Markus\n\nGreat. Anybody got a decent diplomacy skill? - Jonny\n\nWe donâ€™t need a diplomacy skill for this. - Darick\n\nSurrender whilst you still can, rebel scum. We have your signal tracked and youâ€™re being surrounded as we speak. If you... - Marcus\n\nI pull the plug on the holodeck. - Darick\n\nThe rest looks at each other dumbfounded.\n\nWell, I guess thatâ€™s one way to do it. - Jonny\n\nA few moments after the tall hologram disappears, the first ships breach the ships firing range. Having set up shop in the main turret, what do you do, Tess? - Markus\n\nI start blasting any ship that is headed directly for us. - Tess\n\nHold up, we canâ€™t outgun that fleet. Are you trying to get us killed?! - Jonny\n\nRight, because they probably just flew this way to talk this over. Besides, they wonâ€™t shoot as long as we have the princess aboard. - Tess\n\nJonny struggles to reason against this, as Markus turns to Derick.\n\nThe engines are warming up. Where to, captain? - Markus\n\nJonny and Tess look at Derick expectantly. Derick pauses for a moment, and then searches through his folder, spilling all kinds of handouts over the table. He grabs one, a star map with a long list of system names.\n\nWeâ€™ll lose them in the asteroid field around the blown up moon. Then weâ€™ll jump to Baricus XI. - Derick\n\nAww, come on - Jonny\n\nItâ€™s just the closest unaffiliated system, thatâ€™s all. - Derick\n\nJonny complains some more, but Tess shuts him up. \n\nAll right, sounds good. You start to move your small gunship...  - Markus\n\nItâ€™s called the SS Ination. - Jonny\n\nHad we settled on that? If not, Iâ€™d like to hold off on a name like that until weâ€™re no longer being chased by desperate Imperial loyalists trying to save their one chance for a legacy. - Tess\n\nMarkus laughs and continues.\n\nRight, of course. The SS Ination, or whichever name you prefer, starts making its way towards the nearby rubble field surrounding the broken moon. The first ships have entered your firing range, roll a gun turret attack if you will, Tess. Derick, in a sec you can roll a piloting check for entering the rubble field, so keep those numbers ready. - Markus\n\nAll right, some actual fighting! - Jonny\n\nAs Jonny calls this out, some of the other pub goers look around for signs of a fight breaking out, only to frown at the dice and papers over on the groupâ€™s table.\n\nIf thatâ€™s what you call actual fighting, you better hope you donâ€™t get drafted, boy. - Frank\n\nOh zip it Frank. Go back to watching some people play a game youâ€™re too old to play yourself. - Jonny\n\nAt least I could play it at some point in my life, pipsqueak. - Frank\n\nAs Jonny gets fired up and turns to Frank to insult him some more, he knocks over Tessâ€™ drink. The beer spills over some of the papers before Derick, Tess, and Markus can clear the table. \n\nOh, shit. Sorry Tess. - Jonny\n\nYou fucking idiot. - Tess\n\nTess slaps Jonny on the back of his head.\n\nHaha, I can tell why you prefer pretend fighting over the real thing, boy. - Frank\n\nArgh. Iâ€™ll go get a towel or something. - Jonny\n\nHere, take this. - Bart\n\nBart says, reaching over past Frank to throw a towel onto the wet table. \n\nAh, thanks. - Jonny\n\nWell... - Derick\n\nDerick holds up a soaked character sheet. Jonny looks dejectedly at his feet.\n\nSorry, man. - Jonny\n\nThatâ€™s okay, it was time for a new one anyway. I could hardly erase the pencil lines from my health because of the wear. - Derick\n\nYou do often take the brunt of it. - Markus\n\nThey laugh it off.\n\nAs the table gets cleaned, or at least dried off a bit, Markus continues. \n\nSo, whatâ€™d you roll for the attack, Tess? - Markus\n\nWhat? Oh, pretty low, so Iâ€™m pretty sure I missed. - Tess\n\nThe turret lets loose the first volley of shots at the Imperial fighters, but you immediately notice these arenâ€™t your everyday pilots. They skilfully dodge your shots and approach the ship. - Markus\n\nAt least try to keep them at a distance, they wonâ€™t kill us but they will track us if they get the chance. - Jonny\n\nRight as you communicate that over the radio, a flash of light comes streaking towards the ship. - Markus\n\nWhat?! - Tess and Jonny in unison\n\nMarkus picks up some dice and rolls them, referencing some papers.\n\nAn instant later, the light cascades into a rainbow of colours as the laser hits the shipâ€™s shields. - Markus\n\nSo much for them not killing us. I start some evasive manoeuvres. - Derick\n\nThat makes no sense! They know we have the princess on board. - Tess\n\nUnless... Damn, what is that Galaxer planning? Does he want to kill his only heir? - Jonny\n\nOh my god, thatâ€™s it. There must be another heir. He doesnâ€™t mind killing her if it kills us, too. - Tess\n\nI guess itâ€™s possible we missed one. - Derick\n\nThere wasnâ€™t even a file on this heir in the Empireâ€™s archives! How is there another layer of secrecy? - Jonny\n\nGalaxerâ€™s a sly bastard, thatâ€™s for sure. Wow. - Tess\n\nNow I feel kind of bad for this lady. - Derick\n\nAh, right. Yeah, sucks to be her. - Jonny\n\nImperial scum is imperial scum. - Tess\n\nDidnâ€™t this planet just rebel against the Empire? - Derick\n\nDerick, give me a piloting roll for those manoeuvres. Itâ€™ll be tough, as youâ€™re reaching the edge of the rubble field. Debris litters the space around you. - Markus\n\nHmph. Thatâ€™s not the best, but my piloting skill applies, right? - Derick \n\nHow much could that possibly be? - Jonny\n\nPlus sixteen. - Derick\n\nJonny and Tess stare at Derick for a second, before exclaiming their surprise.\n\nHow the hell did you get such a big bonus? What skills did you choose since the last time we played? - Tess\n\nIâ€™d show you my build, but... - Derick\n\nDerick holds up his still damp and ruined character sheet.\n\nYou succeed in shaking the attacks from the fighters as you fly further into the rubble belt. The fighters behind you donâ€™t follow as soon as the rubble starts getting denser, but instead split up and circle the outskirts of the rubble belt. If you keep up the fast pace, youâ€™ll have to roll to avoid smashing into the rubble parts. - Markus\n\nThatâ€™s fine, Iâ€™ll slow down. - Derick\n\nSlowly, you retreat further and further back into the chaos of the rubble belt. You radar shows you more and more ships spreading out, surrounding the area. From further back, between the rocks and salvage flying around, you can see one of the destroyer ships moving steadily towards the moon. - Markus\n\nWe have to lose them quickly, we can never escape the destroyerâ€™s radar in this garbage. - Jonny\n\nGreat. So itâ€™s â€˜get smashed by space rubbleâ€™, â€˜get shot by Imperial fightersâ€™ or â€˜hide and get blasted by a destroyer torpedoâ€™. Anybody got any smart ideas? - Tess\n\nDerick and Jonny exchange glances, and start searching through their sheets for an answer. Markus stands up, grabbing the empty mugs. \n\nIâ€™ll go and grab some more drinks whilst you scramble in the face of your inevitable demise. - Markus\n\nOh, weâ€™ll get that bastard Galaxer. Somehow. - Jonny\n\nA triple for me. - Tess\n\nThis might be a problem. We donâ€™t have a lot of fuel left for fancy manoeuvres, if we want to get to another planet in the system before jumping, that is. - Derick\n\nOh, weâ€™ve got a problem alright. - Tess\n\nNo, I think Iâ€™ve got a plan. If we route most of our power to--- - Jonny\n\nTess points at the bar, where Markus is approached by a short blond girl. With her band t-shirt she couldnâ€™t even name a song of herself, she laughs and twirls her hair as she talks to Markus.\n\nIs that Debbie? - Derick\n\nAh, fuck. - Jonny\n\nGuess we know who wins tonight. - Tess\n\nMarkus is taken by the arm and dragged to Debbieâ€™s table. They watch for a moment as Markus gets a seat in the far corner of the nook, and a drink is shoved his way. The group starts talking and laughing it off as they read questions off small cards. Markus soon laughs with them. Tess grabs Derickâ€™s beer and chugs the last quarter of it.\n\nShe cucked us. - Tess\n\nAre you serious? The how-manieth time is this that we get ditched in the middle of a session like this? - Jonny\n\nHeâ€™ll be back. - Derick\n\nTo tell us heâ€™s sorry and grab his coat, yeah. He needs to grow some balls and stand up to her. - Jonny\n\nMarkus is a good guy. He said he felt guilty when this happens. - Derick\n\nAnd yet, here we are. - Jonny\n\nTess stands up and puts on her jacket.\n\nIâ€™m not waiting half an hour to get ditched again. - Tess\n\nAw, Tess, come on. At least stay and get drunk with us. Itâ€™s a Friday night. - Jonny\n\nYou still need a ride, Tess? - Derick\n\nNo, itâ€™s fine. Iâ€™ll walk. - Tess\n\nReally? Not you too, Tess. - Jonny\n\nSee you guys next ditch session. - Tess\n\nTess exits the pub into the cold spring weather. She looks at the motorcycles in front of the building with envy, before lighting a cigarette. After a single puff, she throws it away, cursing the nicotine free cigarettes. \nItâ€™s still pretty early, around midnight. The small town is still pretty lively, but not on the streets. Tess walks home through the cold, entering her auntâ€™s place quietly. She is surprised to see her 14 year old niece and her friend still awake on the couch.\n\nHey Tess! - Sam (friend)\n\nOh, hey Tess. Youâ€™re back early. - Hannah (niece)\n\nSure am. Blame Markus. What are you watching? - Tess\n\nTess plops down on the couch in between the two. The girls share the blanket and a can of coke with Tess.\n\nA horror movie. - Hannah\n\nWhich one? - Tess\n\nThat one with the nurse you recommended. - Sam\n\nIâ€™m pretty sure I never told you guys to watch it. - Tess\n\nNo, but you talked about it on the phone. - Sam\n\nOkay, maybe we need to talk about you stalking my aunt. - Hannah\n\nWhat? No, Iâ€™m not stalking her, I just overheard... - Sam\n\nSam and Hannah get spooked by a jump scare in the movie. Tess laughs.\n\nOh yeah. This movie is so bad, itâ€™s great. - Tess\n\nThey sit watching the movie for a bit.\n\nDonâ€™t you have work tomorrow morning? - Sam\n\nWhat did I just say? - Hannah\n\nNo! I--- - Sam\n\nHaha, well Iâ€™d planned on being back from the pub a little later than this, so Iâ€™m still fine. Thanks for the trust, though. - Tess\n\nI didnâ€™t mean to---obviously you knew, but--- - Sam\n\nTess laughs and pets Samâ€™s head.\n\nSheâ€™s cute. - Tess\n\nSam gets quiet and retreats under the blankets.\n\nDonâ€™t feed it. Iâ€™m trying to condition her to stop. - Hannah\n\nI bet the boys love it. Are you jealous? - Tess\n\nItâ€™s not all about boys. - Hannah\n\nIf you say so. Ooh, wait look closely here. - Tess\n\nTess points at the screen and the girls look closely. A jump-scare sends them screaming under the blankets, and Tess laughs.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/Stories/Unnamed/The-Nameless-Expedition-Scene-2":{"title":"Nameless - Scene 2","content":"The sun lazily creeps into the shop as Tess raises the metallic shutter blocking off the shop from the street.

Morning to you too, Kelly. - Tess\n\nHmph - Crone, now Kelly.\n\nThe crone walks in and starts grabbing articles from the storeâ€™s all-too-varied supply. As soon as the screen is all the way up, Kelly walks back to the counter. She leans forward on the counter, her hands cupping her head, glaring at Kelly.\nThen, a familiar voice disturbs her from her ill-wishing.\n\nOrange the new seasonal colour?

Iâ€™m in the back, prepping the delivery orders. - Tess\n\nThey still deliver? Damn, I thought that was a temporary thing. - Derick\n\nPretty nice cashflow, so yeah. - Tess\n\nSounds like a decent job. - Derick\n\nItâ€™s all right. Howâ€™re your classes? - Tess\n\nPretty tough, all things considered. I actually have a class with Markus now. - Derick\n\nHuh? Oh, right. Itâ€™s rough, but funny stuff happens, too. A few days ago--- - Markus\n\nJonny sets down a coke in front of Tess, and a beer in front of Markus. Markus lifts an eyebrow, but Jonny then motions him to scoot over. Markus does, and Jonny joins them.\n\nYeah, yeah. You sit down next to some girl and start talking to her thinking sheâ€™s Tess. Enough of your stories. Time to tell of my exploits. - Jonny\n\nWait, what? - Tess\n\nDude, thatâ€™s not the story I was going to--- - Markus\n\nThis afternoon, I, Jonny, conqueror of maidens, deliverer of maternal instincts, went on a date. - Jonny\n\nI sure hope that wasnâ€™t your introduction to her. - Derick\n\nNo, those titles still need some work. - Jonny\n\nDeliverer of maternal instincts? Big yikes, dude. - Derick\n\nAnyway, as I told Tess this morning, I met her in class, but she lives here, too. - Jonny\n\nWow, thatâ€™s... unlikely. Do we know her? - Derick\n\nNo, she had pretty alternative schooling up to college. - Jonny\n\nAlternative. Sounds like a euphemism. - Derick\n\nJust shut up and let me tell the story. - Jonny\n\nWe met at the BrainSplat coffee place. I was running a little late, but was only late for being early, so everything was all right. She was already there, looking out the window with dreamy eyes. I walked up, asking if sheâ€™d waited long. Immediately, she cracked a joke about Chronocops. A time travel joke! So I quipped one back, and we were both laughing our asses off. By the time they came to take our order, we were already talking about everything that was wrong with season 2. - Jonny\n\nWow. - Derick\n\nHahah. Typical youâ€™d dream about a girl, not with the â€˜perfectâ€™ figure, or a kind personality, but one you can bitch with about your tv shows. - Tess\n\nOh, sheâ€™s kind. And sheâ€™s a looker, too. Here, Iâ€™ll show you. - Jonny\n\nBut that makes me wonder. If that surprised you, how come youâ€™d even invited her on the date. Didnâ€™t you know her from class? - Derick\n\nOoh, very sharp, Derick. If you didnâ€™t know she was a nerd, you wouldnâ€™t have had the guts to ask her out. How did that happen? - Tess\n\nPerhaps just a rare success story for this determined boy right here. - Jonny\n\nYouâ€™re asking me to believe in miracles here. - Derick\n\nYup. Iâ€™m not buying it. You can distract yourself with your phone all you want, I can tell by your face that youâ€™re covering something up. - Tess\n\nWhy canâ€™t you guys just believe in me? Would it really be so hard to believe that I didnâ€™t screw it up this one time? - Jonny\n\nOh, we believe in you, all right. - Tess\n\nHmhmm. In your consistency. - Derick\n\nHahah. Well crap. Youâ€™ve got me. Itâ€™s actually a little embarrassing, so I was hoping not to tell you. Oh, Iâ€™ve got the picture, right here! - Jonny\n\nThe three of them leaned over to look at the picture, showing a pretty redheaded girl. Tessâ€™ eyes darted up to the top of the screen, where she saw the time. \n\nSheâ€™s pretty---shit! - Tess\n\nWhat?! - Jonny\n\nOh, no. Not like that. Sheâ€™s pretty. Iâ€™m late. - Tess\n\nOh. Oh, so you like her? - Jonny\n\nTess hurried grabs her jacket, putting it on as she stands up. \n\nYeah, she looks cool. I would say bring her over some time, but just focus on not fucking this up for now. - Tess\n\nYeah! Wait... - Jonny\n\nOh, and you still owe me that embarrassing story! - Tess\n\nAs Tess finishes, she shoots a wink and a fingergun at Jonny, before passing through the door. Jonny turns to the others and smiles widely. \n\nHappy? - Derick\n\nYup. I just got confirmation from an objective party. Iâ€™m dating a hot nerd. - Jonny\n\nI would hardly call Tess objective. Also, are you guys officially going out now? - Derick\n\nOfficial smomishle. I like her, she likes me. Thatâ€™s what matters. Right Markus? - Jonny\n\nHuh? Oh, Iâ€™d be careful if I were you. Girls tend to find that official side of things important. - Markus\n\nReally? Oh man... - Jonny\n\nAre you all right, Markus? - Derick\n\nIâ€™m okay. Itâ€™s just... Whyâ€™d you have to tell her about that thing in class, Jonny? - Markus\n\nYou were just telling her that story. I thought Iâ€™d skip the nonsense and get to my story. - Jonny\n\nI wasnâ€™t going to tell her that. That was between us three. *Sigh* shit. - Markus\n\nI---I didnâ€™t realise. Sorry, man. - Jonny\n\nThat was a dumb thing to do, Jonny. - Derick\n\nSorry... It didnâ€™t seem like she minded, though. If that helps. - Jonny\n\nOh, she minded. She just isnâ€™t the type to let it show. - Markus\n\nYou might be overthinking this, Markus. - Derick\n\nSheâ€™s already icing me out. This is just great. - Markus\n\nWhy did it even happen, though? In class. - Jonny\n\nFuck if I know! *Sigh* Iâ€™m off. - Markus\n\nMarkus. - Derick\n\nMarkus gets out of the booth, pushing past Jonny and leaves the bar.\n\nJeez. Ass. - Jonny\n\nDude. - Derick\n\nI know. - Jonny","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/Stories/Unnamed/The-Nameless-Expedition-Scene-4":{"title":"Nameless - Scene 4","content":"Youâ€™re late. Why are you late? - Aunt Erin\n\nTess walks into the house, greeted by a group of her auntâ€™s friends. She dusts off her shoes before stepping in.\n\nItâ€™s all right, Erin. Joseph isnâ€™t even here yet, the bastard. - Russell\n\nHeâ€™ll probably play it off like he thought we were meeting at the place. Thatâ€™s what he usually does on game nights. - Sandra\n\nI think I saw him at Ventleyâ€™s, actually. - Tess\n\nReally? - Jackie\n\nOh, you mean the place he suggested we meet at so he could watch the game? Surprising. - Sandra\n\nWhat a guy, haha. - Russell\n\nThatâ€™s where you were off to? The bar? Grabbing a quick drink before youâ€™re forced to hang out with your cute little niece? - Aunt Erin\n\nLike Iâ€™d ever want to numb myself for that. - Tess\n\nImplying you do numb yourself for other things. - Russell\n\nAn â€˜Ooh!â€™, followed by knowing looks towards Tess. Tess looks away and rolls her eyes.\n\nDid you drink anything, though? - Aunt Erin\n\nJust a coke---that I didnâ€™t even touch. Damn, missed out on a free drink. - Tess\n\nWe have coke in the fridge. Just donâ€™t give Hannah too much. - Aunt Erin\n\nWeâ€™ll be fine, Erin. You guys go. Sorry I was late. - Tess\n\nRussellâ€™s phone rings. He looks at the screen and then raises a finger as if to say â€˜now watchâ€™. \n\nHey, Joseph. Where have been? Weâ€™ve been waiting for a while. Hm. Hmhmm. Oh, so you thought we were meeting at the place itself? - Russell\n\nRussell raises a hand at Sandra, who high fives him. \n\nNo, thatâ€™s fine. Weâ€™ll head over now. By the way, what was the final score? You donâ€™t say. - Russell\n\nAunt Erin rolls her eyes looking at Tess, who smiles back. The friendship in this group was enviable, and not to mention old. The roots trace back to elementary school. Thatâ€™s good mileage. \n\nAunt Erin yells sheâ€™s leaving to Hannah, who comes down to give her mother a hug. \nGot any fun plans for tonight? - Aunt Erin\n\nShe adds, looking at Tess:\n\nNo more horror movies. - Aunt Erin\n\nTess is taking me to the cinema. Thereâ€™s this new really bad teen romance movie. Weâ€™re going to trash it. - Hannah\n\nYou girls have the weirdest taste in movies. Well, have fun tonight. - Aunt Erin\n\nYou too. - Tess\n\nDonâ€™t forget to lock the doors. - Aunt Erin\n\nThe door closes as the company leaves. The two girls look at each other and smile. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-08T16:18:18.833944349Z","tags":null},"/notes/this-one":{"title":"this one!","content":"\nYou found a link!
